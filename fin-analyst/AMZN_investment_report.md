# Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Investment Report

## Investment Decision Matrix

| Valuation Method | Signal | Reasoning |
|------------------|--------|-----------|
| DCF | SELL | DCF valuation suggests overvaluation at current price (125.50 vs intrinsic 98.72). Used 9.4% growth rate and 8.5% discount rate. |
| Payback Time | SELL | Extremely long payback period (34.5 years) based on owner earnings of $36.8B and market cap of $1.28T. |
| Owner Earnings Yield | SELL | Owner earnings yield (FCF/EV) of 2.9% falls far below 10% benchmark (10-cap rule). |
| Ben Graham Formula | BUY | Graham formula suggests undervaluation (V = 4.04 × (8.5 + 2×18.7) × 4.4/4.5%). Used 18.7% EPS growth and 4.5% bond yield. |
| P/E Multiples | SELL | Trailing P/E of 58.7 significantly exceeds industry standard (SELL >25). Forward P/E of 45.2 still elevated. |
| Asset-Based | SELL | Price/Book of 8.9 indicates premium valuation (146.1B book value). |
| SOTP | HOLD | Sum-of-parts valuation (EV $1.32T) suggests fair valuation relative to current price. |
| DDM | N/A | Not applicable - AMZN does not pay dividends. |
| PEG Ratios | SELL | High PEG ratio (trailing P/E 58.7 ÷ 18.7% growth = 3.14) suggests overvaluation relative to growth. |

## Final Assessment

**Overall Recommendation:** SELL

**Vote Tally:**
- BUY: 1
- HOLD: 1
- SELL: 6
- N/A: 1

## Key Considerations

**Why SELL Makes Sense (4 Key Strengths of the Signal):**
1. Majority of valuation methods (6/8 applicable) indicate overvaluation
2. Extremely high P/E ratios (58.7 trailing, 45.2 forward) suggest premium pricing
3. Low owner earnings yield (2.9%) compared to historical benchmarks
4. Long payback period (34.5 years) indicates poor capital efficiency at current price

**Risks to Consider (4 Cautionary Factors):**
1. Graham formula suggests undervaluation - potential for growth to exceed expectations
2. AWS segment may justify higher multiples due to cloud computing growth
3. Strong historical growth rates (22.1% revenue CAGR, 32.4% FCF CAGR)
4. Market may continue to award premium for dominant market position

## Growth-Adjusted Analysis

The valuation is highly sensitive to growth assumptions:
- Current DCF uses 9.4% growth rate - 1% increase would raise fair value by ~$15
- PEG ratio of 3.14 suggests market is pricing in growth that may be difficult to sustain
- Historical growth rates (18.7% EPS CAGR) are significantly higher than current projections
- Any slowdown in AWS growth would disproportionately impact valuation

## Final Recommendation

**Action:** SELL

**Risk-Adjusted Target Price Range:** $90-$110

**Rationale:**
- Based on 6/8 valuation methods indicating overvaluation
- Suggests 12-28% downside from current $125.50 price
- Upper range ($110) accounts for potential growth surprises
- Lower range ($90) reflects potential multiple compression in bear case

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Consider selling in tranches to manage volatility risk
2. Re-evaluate if price approaches $90 level or growth accelerates
3. Monitor AWS growth rates and retail margin improvements
4. Watch for changes in interest rate environment that could impact multiples
